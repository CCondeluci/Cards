# Cards

This is a self-managed database of programmed card effects for use with the Automated Weiss Schwarz Simulator project. Unlike the card data distributed with the application itself, this database will be kept immediately up to date with new sets as they are cretaed (even if they are not fully tested or validated by the original development team). This is not meant to undermine the work that group does to develop cards, but rather provide (mostly) working card effects for new sets as quickly as possible so that the simulator can be used for rapid testing of sets before they release in paper (or in English).

## Instructions

1. Navigate to wherever on your machine you installed the most recent version of the simulator. Go to \Weiss Schwarz_Data\StreamingAssets\Cards.
2. Delete everything in that folder. If this makes you uncomfortable, create a duplicate of your simulator installation just for use with this DB.
3. Here you have two options- if you're Git-savvy, you can instantiate this repository inside that folder. That way, you can just pull this database to always be constantly updated. If you don't know how to do that, just download and drop the contents of this repo into the "Cards" folder (so it looks like how it did before you deleted everything). I recommend quickly learning how to set up a Git repo inside that folder though, that way you can have 1-click updates.
4. Go get the card images. Can't help you with this one, but if you work with the simulator enough, you probably know where to find them.
5. Get whoever you are playing with to do exactly the same thing you did. If you have file mis-matches while playing on line, the program will instantly crash for both of you.

## Notes

Most sets have been refactored to make sure that they match the folder structure pattern. Some sets do not support this usual structure due to being hardcoded in the game's resources:

- Adventure Time
- Batman Ninja
- Bofuri
- DanMachi
- Goblin Slayer
- GGO
- Gurren Lagann
- Mushoku Tensei
- No Game No Life
- Nisekoi
- Persona 3
- Persona 5
